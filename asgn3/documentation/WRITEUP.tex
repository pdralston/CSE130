\section*{Assignment 3}
	I have written my hashtable to be a lock table. This increases concurrency by allowing more threads access to the hash table at a time.\\
	During recursive name lookup I have to lock the entire table which reduces concurrency to 0 until the lookup completes.\\
	I did not do much additional testing. I added some time flags around my code and compared processing times as I increased data size to get
	a rough idea of how quickly my latency increased as workload increased, but by and large I relied on my design to have an acceptable outcome.
	Not the best policy, but my priority goal was to have a more accurately functional offering than I did for asgn2.
	
\section*{Testing}
I used a combination of unit testing and scripting to test the functionality of my program.
